//       DATA TYPES

/*
1) integer: It is used for whole numbers.
The minimum value for integers is -2,147,483,648
The maximum value for integers is 2,147,483,647
integer variables use 32 bits of memory   (8 bits = 1 byte)

2) short: It is used for whole numbers.
The minimum value for short is -32,768
The maximum value for short is 32,767
short variables use 16 bits of memory

3) byte: It is used for whole numbers.
The minimum value for byte is -128
The maximum value for byte is 127
byte variables use 8 bits of memory

Q: What data type will you prefer if you need to store the age of university students?
byte

4) long: It is used for whole numbers.
The minimum value for long -9,223,372,036,854,755,808
The maximum value for long 9,223,372,036,854,755,807
long variables use 64 bits of memory

     Data types about decimals

     1) float: It is used for decimal values
               float variables use 32 bits of memory
         NOTE: When you create float variable, you need to add "F" or "f" at the of the value

     2) double: It is used for decimal values
               double variables use 64 bits of memory

        // Primitive data types have 'values' ONLY.

        /*
                 NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
           String: It is a non- primitive data type.
                   It is used to store sequence of characters (e.g. text)
                   The default value of String is null

           What is the difference between PRIMITIVE and NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES?
           1)  Primitive data types have 'values' ONLY. Non-Primitive data types have values AS WELL AS methods.
           2) Primitive data types are created by Java. We cannot create them. Non-Primitive data types can be created by us.
           3) Primitive data types use lowercase in their names whereas Non-Primitive data types use UPPERCASE in their names
           4) Memory usage in Primitive data types changes from data type to data type. But Non-Primitive data types use same amount
              of memory (we learn details about it later)


          There are two types of memory in Java
          1) Stack  memory: Stores a) Primitive data   b) references of Non-Primitive data
          2) Heap memory: stores Non-Primitive data
